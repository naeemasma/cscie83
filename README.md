Time Series Demand Forecasting

Problem Statement:

The objective of this project is to come up with the best forecasting model to predict air travel demand. The selected dataset is public data, which is available from data.world(Original Source: San Francisco Open Data). This dataset is a San Francisco International Airport Report on Monthly Passenger Traffic Statistics by Airline from 2005 to 2016. Airport data is seasonal. Hence, any comparative analyses would be performed on a period-over-period basis (such as March 2015 vs. March 2016) instead of period-to-period (such as. March 2015 vs. April 2015). Notably, fact and attribute field relationships are not always 1-to-1. For example, Passenger Counts belonging to Southwest Airlines will appear in multiple attribute fields and are additive, allowing us to draw categorical Passenger Counts for the analyses.

Value Proposition: 

The forecasting model developed by this project can be used to predict air travel demand. Airline companies need to make informed decisions about pricing, capacity, and other areas of their business to optimize their operations and maximize their profitability. 

We will use the four steps below to find the best forecasting model for predicting the demand for air travel.

- Gather Information about data/ Data Pre-Processing

- Primary Exploratory data analysis.

- Choose and fit the Model. 

- Use and Evaluate Model.
  
Forecasting Models:

- Linear Regression Forecasting Model(Deg=2) with BoCox Transformation
  
- ARIMA
  
- Autoregression
  
- SARIMAX
